It was here that a visionary named Joel Waldman founded Highland House, a humble factory that would quietly shape the future of India’s handicraft industry.",

          "Within its buzzing workshops, the scent of wood shavings, the clinking of chisels against marble, and the weaving of rattan filled the air with a sense of purpose. Where craftsmanship was a way of life, and every piece created carried the spirit of Mandawa’s rich heritage.",

The talented individuals who honed their craft within its walls carried their skills across the country and beyond — now leading major brands, managing prestigious factories, and founding successful businesses of their own. Today, many pillars of the Indian handicraft and furniture industry trace their roots back to the lessons learned at Highland House.",
